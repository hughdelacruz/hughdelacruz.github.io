<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is an enjoyment to utilize as well (a lot much better than the apps you get with some budget security cameras), though if you want to enter into its cleverest customisations, there is a little bit of a learning curve. For all the more basic smarts, it's terrific, though.
