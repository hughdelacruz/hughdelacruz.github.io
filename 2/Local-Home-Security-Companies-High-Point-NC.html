<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies designed their equipment in this manner to make consumers stick with them longer, due to the fact that switching monitoring companies means numerous dollars down the drain and a big headache for consumers.
