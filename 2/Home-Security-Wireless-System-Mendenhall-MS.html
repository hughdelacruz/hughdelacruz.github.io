Lennar, as it happens, is directly linked now on Amazon's security homepage, but to be clear, the offering is not unique to Lennar property owners. This system provides me a peace of mind.

The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
