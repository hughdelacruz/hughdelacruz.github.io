The first guard showed up early so he could take a look at the entire location and talk to me about my issues. He was expert, courteous and very reassuring. The 2nd guard arrived in the middle of the night and took over. When I showed up in the early morning to get the occasion started, he was likewise expert, comforting and considerate.
