<p>Unlike many other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter occasion notifications just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is better when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals each time you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
