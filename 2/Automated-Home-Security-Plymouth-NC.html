Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals every time you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
