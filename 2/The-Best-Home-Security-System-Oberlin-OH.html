<p>Developing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or house is the obligation of the entire neighborhood. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first question you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The response depends upon a couple of elements: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video footage you intend to save and how long you prepare to keep recorded footage. If there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the footage is going to consume storage space quickly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest video footage as soon as you reach the system's capacity, but if you're not careful, the system might overwrite archived footage that you still need.</p>
