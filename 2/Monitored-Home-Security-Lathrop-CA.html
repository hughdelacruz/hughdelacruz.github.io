As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has pointed out, "understanding that you are being viewed by armed federal government representatives tends to deter things.

Eventually, he warns, "individuals might learn to be mindful about the books and periodicals they check out in public, preventing titles that might alarm unseen observers. They may also put more thought into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang hookers, drug addicts or members."
