<p>There are two main kinds of cameras that can be wired into a video surveillance system: web protocol (IP) cameras and the standard analog cameras. IP cameras are the more modern-day iteration of analog cameras, and while the specific cameras tend to be a little more pricey, they use a number of features that analog cameras do not. Here's a look at the differences between the two types of camera. Today's wireless home security systems are more steady than they used to be.

Here's a look at Vivint security cameras for indoor and outdoor surveillance. Registered for service for my Simon XTi and was active with their service an hour later. The company that installed my alarm went out of business so I was on the hunt for a new monitoring company.

These cameras are true 1080p and work completely right out of the box. They are well lined up and focused. The clarity is actually excellent. Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see respectable after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
