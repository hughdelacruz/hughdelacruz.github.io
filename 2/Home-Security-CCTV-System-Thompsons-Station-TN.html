<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally regular since the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once customers realize that the low-cost customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
