<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the very same resolution spec as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much larger area and therefore uses fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by way of an example. Presume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image across a far bigger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>

<p>The Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is one of the most costly home security cameras around, but it's also among the smartest, too. This weatherproof home security camera has a tamper-resistant design, a triple microphone selection and HDR assistance for better-quality videos than what other cameras produce. It needs to be plugged in to work-- no battery alternative here, sorry-- but the camera comes with a 25-foot power cable, which must aid with installation.</p>
