<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
