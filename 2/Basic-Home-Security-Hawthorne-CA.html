IP cameras work by using an IP (IP represents internet protocol) network, often the very same data network the rest of a company uses. A separate network using category 5 wiring can be used if bandwidth is a problem. In either case, video information is tape-recorded on a server, which implies video information can be located on website or in a remote location. After testing, we sent each of our top choices, as well as the Wyze Camera v2, to Costs McKinley, head of information security at The New York Times (Wirecutter's moms and dad company), for hack testing. (Bill is also a self-proclaimed paranoid infosec man.") He examined each camera for any impressive security defects and concluded that all of our top picks and the budget plan Wyze Cam passed basic security requirements and securities.</p>
