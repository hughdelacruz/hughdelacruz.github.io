<p>For the majority of commercial CCTV systems, structured cabling run throughout the walls, connecting your security cameras to the server or NVR, will be a vital component. While a growing number of wireless security cameras are ending up being popular, specifically for home use, wired security cameras still reign supreme for more permanent and demanding security use. Some people would rather pay an alarm company the regular monthly monitoring rate rather of purchasing a self-monitored security system. Expertly monitored security systems require a monthly monitoring charge that can range from ($ 20 to $60) each month.
