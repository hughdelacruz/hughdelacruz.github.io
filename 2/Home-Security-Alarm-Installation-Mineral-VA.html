<p>Since it's more complex than it should be, we don't suggest the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, signals, and integration all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 per year) to save 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we typically found action missing, thanks to irregular and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
<p>Each smartphone app comes with various settings, so pick one that fits your needs. Place noticing is really beneficial as it can tell when you get home or leave (using your phone's GPS) and turn alarms and camera on or off accordingly.

You can also adjust some cameras to just look at specific places - a doorway for example.</p>
