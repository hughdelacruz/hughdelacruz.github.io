<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most technologically innovative outdoor camera we have actually evaluated. It has a close-up tracking function, which instantly zooms in on motion and then follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high vibrant variety), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between basic motion and individuals, so it cuts down on incorrect alarms, and it can even determine people you have actually identified (after a knowing duration). However like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>

<p>Ring is one of the most significant names in the plugged-in home security video game, and the Ring Indoor Cam is designed to pair with the company's Ring - Always Home app, along with,'s Turner mentions, video doorbells. You can even pair multiple cameras together on the app, if you so desire. Keep in mind that Nest cameras aren't expertly monitored-- that part's on you. (The rest of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.) But given that the majority of retail theft would not trip an alarm anyway (an employee slipping some additional money while offering a client change, for instance), we think it's more important to have premium images so you have the evidence you need. And that's what Nest offers you.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
