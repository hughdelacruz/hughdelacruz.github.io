SimpliSafe reacted with a declaration saying the system would inform users when it detected any type of interference. The company also questioned the video, claiming that there would need to be a best storm of situations for somebody to successfully hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests utilizing two different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors situated 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to replicate the issue. Although our screening shouldn't be taken as conclusive, our company believe this issue is unlikely to be a real-world problem for SimpliSafe customers who own the existing system.</p>

<p>A system that requires a contract might be a wise option for those who are cash-strapped or do not want to pay for the equipment up-front. Why? Since contract-based security systems generally do not come with upfront charges. Rather, the expenses are expanded over the length of the contract. We've seen 1-year, all the way approximately 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you do not wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting arrangement (and who does?). Our choice: No agreement.</p>

Here is what this indicates, by way of an example. Assume two cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the exact same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image across a far larger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
