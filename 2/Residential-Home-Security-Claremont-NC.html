<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests potential transgressors are less likely to commit criminal offense if they think they are being watched or have a higher danger of being collared. This is also referred to as the rational choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is likewise grounded in situational crime prevention strategy, which argues that chances to upset can be minimized by changing a variety of mechanisms such as increasing the risk of an offender being captured, increasing the effort to devote the crime, reducing benefits from crime commission, and minimizing justifications that generate criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011).

Rather, you can filter occasion notices just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs each time you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
