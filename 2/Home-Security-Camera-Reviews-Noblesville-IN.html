In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally regular because the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody going into the shop.
