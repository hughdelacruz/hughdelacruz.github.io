Using sophisticated systems by cops and other public security authorities is especially uncomfortable in a democratic society. In lower Manhattan, for instance, the authorities are preparing to set up a centralized surveillance center where officers can view thousands of video cameras around the downtown - and police-operated cameras have proliferated in numerous other cities across America in just the previous several years.</p>

However, keep in mind that the monitoring company's response time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls need to be validated, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs confirmation from a personal guard. A number of cities also require a license to even operate a home and own security system. Guidelines such as these are developed to limit the time and resources that authorities and fire departments waste on false alarms. Lots of towns will fine you for a lot of incorrect alarms.</p>
