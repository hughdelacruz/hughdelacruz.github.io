Then the phone plays a shrill, electronic acoustic wave to the camera to transfer the WiFi information. (You must play this at complete volume or it won't work). Windows smash, pet dogs groan, felines scream, infants cry. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first 10 seconds. It doesn't work. And it never ever works.</p>
