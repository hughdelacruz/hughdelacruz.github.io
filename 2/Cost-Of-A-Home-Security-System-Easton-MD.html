<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is better when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals each time you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
