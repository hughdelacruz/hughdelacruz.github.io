For $15 monthly, you can add ongoing professional monitoring and a cellular connection, so the system can interact with the monitoring service without a landline.

<p>Sensing units permit cameras to start and stop tape-recording based upon time or motion detection. The one time where lag does become a little an issue is in between recording and discovering motion.

Lookout is actually just a fantastic name for a kit that consists of a Wink smart home hub and a few security oriented sensors. You can't arm and disarm the system. Rather, you turn informs on and off. As you can't deactivate it, it can't do things that a normal self-monitored system can do like activate a camera to record or activate the siren.
