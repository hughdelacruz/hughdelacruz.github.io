Storage capability: For video recorders, the very first concern you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The response hinges on a number of elements: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video footage you plan to keep and how long you prepare to keep recorded footage. The video is going to eat up storage space quickly if there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution.
