<p>Discover how to design, develop, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase worker safety and minimize crime. The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, but it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has a terrific daytime image. In our testing, however, we discovered the motion sensing unit to be touchy, with awful night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are verifying with Arlo whether our unit was malfunctioning, therefore we may review this review. Basically, the Nest camera sits anywhere you put it and records what it sees, conserving the last five days of video footage to the cloud. The large face of the camera gives you an impressive field of view, and the picture you get is of good quality (you can change the resolution; the better it gets, the more information you'll use to wait to the cloud.)
