However suicide opponents are plainly not hindered by camera - and might even be attracted to the television coverage cameras can make sure - and the cost of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up roughly 20 percent of that country's criminal justice budget - far exceeds the minimal advantages that the system might provide in investigating attacks or tried attacks after the fact (see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
