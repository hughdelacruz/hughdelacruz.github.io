<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night.
