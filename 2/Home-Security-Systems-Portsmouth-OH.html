Depending upon the version chosen, it can be sensitive to various frequencies or levels of sound or vibration. The system is based on coaxial or electro-magnetic sensing unit cable with the controller having the ability to distinguish between signals from the cable television or chainwire being cut, an intruder climbing up the fence, or bad climate condition.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely typical because the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once consumers realize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
