To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high vibrant variety), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare general motion and people, so it minimizes false alarms, and it can even determine people you have actually labeled (after a knowing period).

We also experienced above-average connectivity issues, with two Hive test units detaching eight times over 2 months. Scout is very simple to use, specifically if you're a fan of mobile devices.
