<p>Get best-in-class security, plus clever home automation the whole family will like. ADT is a household name, so we often try out their systems to ensure they're still up-to-task. In our most current round of testing, we recognized that ADT is the most popular provider for a reason. We think their home protection + home automation + video packages are nipping at the heels of Vivint. That is, they made us feel secure in our home and kept us plenty hectic with clever wise home features. We particularly liked the ADT Pulse App and controls.</p>
<p>Basically, a wireless security system is comprised of alarms, sensing units, cameras, and numerous detectors all linked to a main control board through radio signals. For instance, a four-camera system that runs 24 hours a day utilizing IP cameras, each with a 2-megapixel resolution and a frame rate of 5 fps, with video compressed into MJPEG files on a NVR, would need 2.79 terabytes of storage area for video, according to the Supercircuits calculator.</p>

Frontpoint's detectors are unsusceptible to pets weighing up to 40 pounds. With ADT, the expert installer can personalize the sensitivity level based on your pet's size.</p>
