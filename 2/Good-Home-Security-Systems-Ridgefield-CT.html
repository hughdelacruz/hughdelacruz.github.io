Picking the package that's right for you depends on the size and layout of your home.</p>
<p>While monitored systems are more comprehensive and do the majority of the work for you, an unmonitored system depends on somebody accountable (we're looking at you) to help do a few of the work. You can usually install these systems on your own, and they are much, much more economical. Also, there's no worry of getting into an agreement you can't leave when you need to. The monetary independence alone makes this alternative much better for some households. In addition, most unmonitored security systems will send notifies to your mobile phone, making it easy to know if there's a risk to your home.</p>
