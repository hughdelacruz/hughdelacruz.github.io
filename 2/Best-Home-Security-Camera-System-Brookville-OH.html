<p>A wired security system was the first kind of security system that was created for homeowners. It must be set up by a professional alarm installation group and, when set up, is difficult to move from one place to another. Wired systems are more common for large homes and are frequently more expensive than a wireless home security system. They can include outdoor cameras and an indoor camera much like the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the group will need to remodel the existing wires in your home. The group will be able to reuse the existing circuitry if you have actually currently installed a wired system in the past and you are upgrading to a new system. However, if this is your first system, the alarm installation procedure can take upwards of 3 hours.</p>
