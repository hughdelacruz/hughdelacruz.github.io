During our hands-on testing of Brinks, we discovered the systems to be rather simple to establish and use-- but not quite as easy as brands like SimpliSafe or Ring Alarm.</p>
<p>The night vision on this camera is applauded time and again in client reviews, and it provides a crisp photo as much as 32 feet.

Tech is expected to make our lives easier and Hive's environment lives up to that. It's all the function without any disappointment.</p>

This will increase the chance of capturing a complete image of everyone's face.</p>
