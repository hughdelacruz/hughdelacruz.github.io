<p>Six basic CCTV security camera innovations exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets.

<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens.

Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>
