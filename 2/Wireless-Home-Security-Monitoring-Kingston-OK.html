<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>

<p>We do not advise the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complicated than it should be. Recordings, informs, and combination all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are stored for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly cost (or $80 annually) to save 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we often discovered action missing out on, thanks to irregular and prolonged spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
<p>Unlike many other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event notices just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is more useful when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals whenever you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
