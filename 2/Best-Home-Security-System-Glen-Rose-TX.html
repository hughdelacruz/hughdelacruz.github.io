<p>CR's take: The Wyze Web Cam V2 is a terrific security camera and a sensational value. It receives an Outstanding rating for video quality and is easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It also succeeds in our privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 14 days of totally free storage for motion-trigged video, individual detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to save video in your area on an SD card.
