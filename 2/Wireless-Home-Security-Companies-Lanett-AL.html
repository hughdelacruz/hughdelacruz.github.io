Using a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly picked words) makes pre-shared essential WPA practically uncrackable. The 2nd generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based on the final IEEE 802.11 i amendment to the 802.11 requirement and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
