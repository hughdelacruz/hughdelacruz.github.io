We design HD CCTV systems for brand new purchases. A1 Security Cameras has a group of expert specialists here with years of hands on experience. When we mean "hands on experience", we suggest going up the ladder, running cable televisions, screening security cameras of all sorts and the whole nine yards that you will have to do to install security camera systems.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
