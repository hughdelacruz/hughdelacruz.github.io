We design HD CCTV systems for brand new purchases. A1 Security Cameras has a group of expert specialists here with years of hands on experience.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
