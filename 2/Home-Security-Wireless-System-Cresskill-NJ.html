<p>If you have a larger home or home you wish to keep an eye on, SimpliSafe may be too limited for you. The only outdoor security camera that's currently offered is the Video Doorbell Pro, which is fantastic for keeping an eye on visitors and package deliveries, however it leaves other parts of your yard susceptible. This system may not be the best fit if you have a large backyard or sheds to secure. Unlike the outdoor Arlo cameras, the Arlo Q does not need a base station-- it connects straight to any Wi-Fi network. However you can link the Q with other Arlo indoor and outdoor cameras in the Arlo app, which is offered for iOS, Android, Fire OS, and any Web web browser. Aside from offering simple access to recordings, the app allows you to change sensitivity so that you're not getting signals every two minutes.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
