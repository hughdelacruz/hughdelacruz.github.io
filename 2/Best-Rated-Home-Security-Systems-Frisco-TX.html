The $260 Fundamentals bundle includes the base station, a keypad, four entry sensors, one motion sensing unit, a yard sign, and two window decals. For $15 each month, you can include around-the-clock professional monitoring and a cellular connection, so the system can communicate with the monitoring service without a landline.
