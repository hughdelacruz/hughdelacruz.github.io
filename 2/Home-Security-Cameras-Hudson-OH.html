<p>The real reason cameras are generally deployed is to decrease much pettier criminal activities. However it has actually not even been shown that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have been thoroughly deployed in public locations, sociologists studying the issue have discovered that they have not lowered criminal offense. "As soon as the crime and offence figures were adapted to take account of the basic down trend in criminal offenses and offenses," criminologists discovered in one study, "reductions were kept in mind in certain classifications but there was no proof to recommend that the cameras had actually minimized criminal offense in general in the city centre." A 2005 research study for the British Home Office also found that cameras did not cut crime or the fear of criminal offense (as had a 2002 study, likewise for the British federal government).</p>
