Then the phone plays a shrill, electronic sound wave to the camera to transmit the WiFi details. (You must play this at complete volume or it won't work). Windows smash, canines howl, cats scream, children weep. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the first 10 seconds. It doesn't work. And it never works.</p>
