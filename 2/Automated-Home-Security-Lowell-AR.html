<p>Arlo Pro 2 likewise has an outstanding Night Vision function. It is geared up with infrared lenses that permit the camera to tape-record videos even in complete darkness. It has about 25 feet of exposure in the evening. As such, even if someone burglarize your home in total darkness, you'll still be able to see them in your mobile phone app. The only issue here is that the tape-recorded video will be black and white and a little dark so you may not be able to see details clearly.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not excellent-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
