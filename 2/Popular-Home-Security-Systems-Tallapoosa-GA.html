<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, the majority of burglar alarms work the precise same way. They use open and closed circuits to move an electrical existing. When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if someone were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be transferred. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking enables the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the alarm system will trigger.</p>
