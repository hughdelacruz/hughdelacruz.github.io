<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally typical because the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when clients understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
