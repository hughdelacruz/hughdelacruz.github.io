With traditional CCTV security cameras, the video signal is processed and transmitted in analog format for local viewing from one central monitoring place. But that doesn't mean you can't utilize analog cameras in an IP-based surveillance environment.

However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>
