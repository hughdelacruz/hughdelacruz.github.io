<p>Scout offers a low regular monthly rate with no agreements, however there is a high up-front equipment cost. Furthermore, there are no surveillance cameras, the selection of products is limited, and they are often sold out.

Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have an agreement, and its equipment pricing is extremely affordable, so it's not a total splurge. However you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>
<p>There is no winner of the various CCTV camera types. And the very best security camera is all about your application and place.
