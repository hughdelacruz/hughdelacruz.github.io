<p>Unlike many other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ).

Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is more useful when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs every time you stroll by.
