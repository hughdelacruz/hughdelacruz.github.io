<p>CR's take: The Wyze Webcam V2 is an excellent security camera and an incredible value. It receives an Exceptional score for video quality and is much easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 2 week of totally free storage for motion-trigged video clips, person detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to save video locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid subscription prepare for extra cloud storage.
