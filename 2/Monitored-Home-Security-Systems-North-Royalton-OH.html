The camera might lawfully do what a peeping tom could refrain from doing. They could peer within windows with the complete protection of the law on their side.

<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can interact with your home network wirelessly, which can be helpful for installation. It also makes your camera more tamper-proof since it doesn't have wires that can be cut. Unfortunately I purchased 4 cameras that look much like these, believing I was going to conserve $14.00 per camera for the same camera. Kid was I incorrect!! These cameras hold true 1080p and work perfectly right out of package. They are well aligned and focused. The clearness is actually terrific. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
