<p>DITEK's burglar alarm rise protectors guard your security system versus short-term surges that can enter through A/C power lines, telephone lines and remote alert zones. Home automation is hassle-free and simple, and wireless systems help you automate your home that much easier. Smart locks, programmable thermostats, cameras, and other automatic home devices are by their very nature wireless, and a lot of home security companies use a home automation plan with an app to remotely control everything on the system. That isn't to state that you can't have actually wired home automation, since you can, but automatic equipment that is hardwired into your system is slower and harder to secure. It isn't very clever. Wireless devices interact more safely and faster to other gadgets on the system and to the monitoring center (if you select monitoring).</p>

<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel posted a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system using a $2 remote. When it detected any type of interference, SimpliSafe reacted with a statement stating the system would inform users. The company also questioned the video, claiming that there would require to be a perfect storm of situations for somebody to successfully hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests utilizing two various 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units located 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to reproduce the concern. Although our screening should not be taken as definitive, we believe this concern is not likely to be a real-world problem for SimpliSafe clients who own the existing system.</p>
