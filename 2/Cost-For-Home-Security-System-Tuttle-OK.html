<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Also great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>

Beyond those limits, we often discovered action missing out on, thanks to irregular and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
