<p>Honeywell's Do It Yourself security system depends on a device called the Camera Base Station. It's an Amazon Echo-like device with a camera on top. It works as the brains of the system, connecting with sensing units and 3rd party-devices through Z-Wave and managing them using the app or voice control. Another area where Arlo excels is customer support. After long-term testing this camera since we first made it a choice in 2016, we observed that our Arlo Q began projecting a pink tint, which appears to be a continuous problem for some owners. We contacted customer assistance, which used a free replacement unit-- despite the fact that the guarantee had long since ended.</p>
<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
