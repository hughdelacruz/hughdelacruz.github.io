<p>CR's take: The Wyze Web Cam V2 is a fantastic security camera and an extraordinary value. It receives an Outstanding score for video quality and is much easier to utilize than the other cameras on this list. It also succeeds in our privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 2 week of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video, individual detection, voice control by means of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to keep video footage locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not use paid subscription plans for additional cloud storage.
