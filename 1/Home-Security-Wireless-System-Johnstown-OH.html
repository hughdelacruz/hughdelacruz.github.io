<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions.
