IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, typically by method of a PoE switch, are then able to send footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR.
