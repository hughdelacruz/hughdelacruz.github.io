<p>Analogue signals can likewise be transformed into a digital signal to make it possible for the recordings to be saved on a PC as digital recordings In that case the analogue video camera should be plugged straight into a video capture card in the computer system, and the card then converts the analogue signal to digital. These cards are fairly cheap, but undoubtedly the resulting digital signals are compressed 5:1 (MPEG compression) in order for the video recordings to be minimized a constant basis.</p>
