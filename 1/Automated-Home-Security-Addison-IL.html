<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring profound however subtle modifications to the character of our public spaces. When citizens are being viewed by the authorities - or conscious they might be seen at any time - they are more awkward and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has pointed out, "knowing that you are being viewed by armed federal government representatives tends to deter things. You don't wish to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he warns, "individuals may find out to be careful about the books and periodicals they read in public, avoiding titles that may alarm hidden observers.

<p>You would be hard-pressed to discriminate between 1080p and 4K resolution when looking at a typical camera image.
