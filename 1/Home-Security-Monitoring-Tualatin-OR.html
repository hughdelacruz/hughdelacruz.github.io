<p>Closed circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance is a form of situational criminal activity avoidance designed to prevent both personal and property crime and can be utilized in place of, or in addition to, authorities.

It is thought that the increased surveillance offered by CCTV will lower criminal offense and increase arrest, without displacing criminal activity to other nearby areas where CCTV is not in use (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
