<p>3 big benefits of wireless security systems for occupants are their portability, expandability and impermanence. Occupants, unlike house owners, typically prevent making long-term changes to their homes.

In contrast, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entryways with removable adhesive. Wireless control board, sensing units and other elements can quickly be established at various residential or commercial properties later on, and wireless systems are quickly broadened with new parts too.
