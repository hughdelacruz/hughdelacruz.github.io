<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've discovered that battery life never matches the manufacturer's stats given that this originates from tests in a controlled environment without constant video recording, which is the most significant perpetrator for short battery life without a doubt. We agree with you about Blink's superior battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, but its recording capacity is a bit restricted to suggest as a top choice.</p>

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
