<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely normal since the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when consumers understand that the economical consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
