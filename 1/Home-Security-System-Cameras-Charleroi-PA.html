Whether you own or lease, you want the very best security camera system for keeping an eye on your home while you're gone.

<p>The NVR gets rid of these issues, because it is instead linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the exact same network, normally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, just due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is connected to the exact same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
