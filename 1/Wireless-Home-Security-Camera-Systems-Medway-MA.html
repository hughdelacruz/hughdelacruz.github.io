I Would certainly purchase from cctvsecuritypros again. I highly suggest this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stick out-- it's what offers the video history and smarter notifies, for example. However, those functions come at a relatively high price: $5 per month ($50 each year) for the very first camera for five days of video history, $10 each month ($100 each year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 per month ($300 per year) for 30 days of video history.

An individual hidden camera built into a watch or pen might be a good option if you require to record a crucial conference in a public location.
