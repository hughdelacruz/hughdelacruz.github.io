<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Likewise nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
