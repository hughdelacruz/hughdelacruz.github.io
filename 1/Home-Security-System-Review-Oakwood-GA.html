<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function.

<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is a pleasure to utilize as well (a lot better than the apps you get with some spending plan security cameras), though if you wish to enter its cleverest customisations, there is a bit of a learning curve. For even more basic smarts, it's great, though.

If you're looking for an alarm that is set up by an installation group and monitored entirely by a security company, then the wired system may be the better alternative for you. Both are equally prone to incorrect alarms, so it depends upon your personal preference. Easily couple with Ring Video Doorbells and Ring Security Cams, Alexa-enabled gadgets and third-party alarm accessories for one total system.</p>
