<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely typical since the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as clients recognize that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
