<p>The genuine reason cameras are normally deployed is to reduce much pettier criminal activities. However it has actually not even been shown that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have actually been extensively released in public locations, sociologists studying the concern have discovered that they have not decreased crime. "As soon as the criminal activity and offense figures were gotten used to take account of the basic down pattern in crimes and offenses," criminologists found in one study, "reductions were noted in specific categories but there was no evidence to recommend that the cameras had reduced criminal activity overall in the city centre." A 2005 study for the British Home Office also found that cameras did not cut criminal activity or the worry of crime (as had a 2002 study, also for the British government).</p>
