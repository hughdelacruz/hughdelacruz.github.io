<p>In industrial plants, CCTV equipment may be utilized to observe parts of a procedure from a main control room, for example when the environment is not ideal for human beings. CCTV systems may operate continuously or only as needed to monitor a particular event. A more advanced type of CCTV, utilizing digital video recorders (DVRs), provides taping for potentially several years, with a variety of quality and efficiency choices and additional features (such as motion detection and email alerts). More recently, decentralized IP cameras, maybe equipped with megapixel sensors, assistance recording directly to network-attached storage devices, or internal flash for entirely stand-alone operation.</p>
<p>Cameras with built in wifi that speak to an existing network must be within 300 feet for optimum efficiency. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera near the NVR is certainly something to be taken into account. For instance if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of a problem but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on second story wall, this would cause a disturbance in the signal.

<p>The real reason cameras are generally released is to reduce much pettier crimes. However it has actually not even been shown that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have actually been thoroughly released in public places, sociologists studying the concern have found that they have actually not reduced criminal offense. "As soon as the crime and offense figures were adjusted to take account of the basic downward trend in criminal activities and offenses," criminologists discovered in one study, "reductions were kept in mind in specific classifications however there was no proof to recommend that the cameras had decreased crime in general in the city centre." A 2005 research study for the British Home Office also discovered that cameras did not cut criminal activity or the fear of crime (as had a 2002 study, also for the British government).</p>

<p>Nurse calling systems usually include emergency situation buttons or pull strings within the patient's bathroom. If a client is having difficulty, he can press the button or pull the string and it will send an alert to the nurse station. This is a basic switch that is generally open or normally closed.

My mind conceptualized a method of not only supplying the customer with the patient-monitoring system but incorporating it into their antiquated nurse call station system.</p>
