<p>We like that the Argus 2 comes with a color night vision option, however the white and black version can in fact be clearer and offer you higher-quality video. This isn't truly a big offer considering the Argus 2's rate and all its other functions-- however for the record, stick with black and white. With Arlo Pro 3, you'll get 3 months of Arlo clever service. But the coolest feature is that you can charge it with the help of solar energy with a photovoltaic panel charger.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>
