In our screening, however, we found the motion sensor to be sensitive, with horrible night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot. We are confirming with Arlo whether our unit was defective, and so we might review this review. Fundamentally, the Nest camera sits wherever you put it and records what it sees, saving the last five days of video footage to the cloud.
