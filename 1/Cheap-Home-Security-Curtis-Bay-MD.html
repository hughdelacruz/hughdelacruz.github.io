<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not terrific-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching.

Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
