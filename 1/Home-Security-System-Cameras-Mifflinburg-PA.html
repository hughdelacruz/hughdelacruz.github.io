If you have a large backyard or outbuildings to secure, this system might not be the very best fit. Unlike the outdoor Arlo cameras, the Arlo Q does not require a base station-- it links directly to any Wi-Fi network. But you can link the Q with other Arlo indoor and outdoor cameras in the Arlo app, which is available for iOS, Android, Fire OS, and any Web browser.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
