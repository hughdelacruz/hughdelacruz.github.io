<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations.
