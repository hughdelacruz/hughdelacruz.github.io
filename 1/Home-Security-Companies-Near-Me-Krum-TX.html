Homeowners can pick from outdoor or indoor security cameras that can tape-record footage when an alarm is triggered, video doorbell cameras, spotlight cameras, baby-sitter cameras, and more. All of these cameras can be incorporated into the general system so the home can be monitored by video from anywhere.
