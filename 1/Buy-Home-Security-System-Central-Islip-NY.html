<p>Best Expert Installation Security Company - While some security systems offer simple Do It Yourself installation, other companies use (and sometimes require) professional installation. Professional installation is readily available for wireless and hardwired home security systems. Keep in mind that cameras with two-way audio generally work like walkie talkies. You press a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's happening on the other end. And while this is a quite standard function in indoor cameras, two-way audio is reasonably rare in outdoor security cameras.</p>
<p>SimpliSafe's 3 essential strengths are its ease of use, the number and range of pre-designed security packages they use, and their robust trial and service warranty periods.

And it uses 20 different system packages, 16 of which for the most recent version of their security equipment and four for their legacy system.

With many DIY systems, such as the SimpliSafe Home Security Kit, the Ring Alarm Security Set, and the Nest Secure, you purchase the hardware outright and can avoid any monthly fees if you choose to self-monitor. If you include monitoring, costs will differ: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 per month for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 per month.
