<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
