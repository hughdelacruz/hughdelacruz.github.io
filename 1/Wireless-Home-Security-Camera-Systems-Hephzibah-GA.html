<p>Developing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or house is the responsibility of the entire neighborhood. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first question you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The answer hinges on a couple of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video you mean to save and the length of time you plan to keep documented footage. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the video is going to eat up storage area quickly.
