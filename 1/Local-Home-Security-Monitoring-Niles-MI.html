<p>Do-it-yourself home security companies aren't like the ADTs and Vivints of the world. Rather of locking you into a multiyear contract with a broad coverage-based monthly cost, a lot of DIY systems give you the flexibility to picked how and when you monitor your home. That typically means you can register for a monitoring service on an optional basis and cancel whenever - without early termination charges or other hidden charges. Elements we thought about included the quality of the security cameras (do they have motion detection and night vision?), is there a monitoring strategy, can window sensing units and door sensing units be integrated, whether the system had a mobile app, can it deal with your door locks and can it be included into an existing smart home setup, consisting of with voice commands through Amazon Alexa.</p>
