<p>So, while alarm systems may have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a total security plan, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the community ought to shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm use resulted in improved public safety-- that is, alarms led to much higher burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer break-ins throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more evident.
