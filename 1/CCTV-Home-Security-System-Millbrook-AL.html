<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your home so we could point them at the exact same spot and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting components, which I had installed on the porch by a certified electrical expert (who happens to be my partner). All of the cameras were linked to the same 2.4 GHz network through a Wi-Fi router inside (around 40 feet from the cameras); service to your house was Verizon Fios.</p>

<p>There are 2 main types of cameras that can be wired into a video surveillance system: internet protocol (IP) cameras and the standard analog cameras. IP cameras are the more contemporary version of analog cameras, and while the individual cameras tend to be a bit more costly, they provide a variety of features that analog cameras do not. Here's a look at the differences between the 2 kinds of camera. Today's wireless home security systems are more stable than they used to be. However, they are still subject to disturbance and they are still susceptible to being hacked even if the signal is secured.</p>
<p>Self-monitored systems, like most security systems, are sold online and are typically offered in packages. Many self-monitored packages come with a starter package that normally includes an at home camera, a door and window sensing unit, and a base station to link the devices. The majority of companies give house owners the capability to add additional components like another camera, contact sensors, a panic button, keypad, smoke alarm, carbon monoxide gas detectors, or a crucial fob.</p>
<p>The 2nd wireless function relates to how your security system interacts with the alarm monitoring station. Older security systems would use a home phone line to call out" and interact with the alarm monitoring station. However, many families no longer use a phone line in their home. So, how do we get your alarm to communicate with the monitoring station? Much in the very same way you do - we can connect through the internet or through a wireless mobile phone signal.</p>
