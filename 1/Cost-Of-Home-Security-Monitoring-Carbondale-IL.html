Moreover they can not transfer fluid video, only still frame images or low resolution bits of video. Blink Security Cameras are a good example of a system we are constantly helping clients change. As professionals in the industry our advice is to stay away. Initially inspect the providers return policy and 2nd keep the invoice if you do buy them.</p>
