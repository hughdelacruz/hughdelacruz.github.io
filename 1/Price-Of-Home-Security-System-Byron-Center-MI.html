<p>Establishing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or home is the duty of the whole neighborhood. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first question you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The response depends upon a couple of factors: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you intend to store and the length of time you prepare to keep recorded video footage. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the video footage is going to consume storage area quickly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest footage as soon as you reach the system's capability, however if you're not careful, the system may overwrite archived video footage that you still need.</p>
