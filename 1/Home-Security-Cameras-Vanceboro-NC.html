While more and more wireless security cameras are becoming popular, especially for home usage, wired security cameras still reign supreme for more irreversible and requiring security usage. Some people would rather pay an alarm company the monthly monitoring rate rather of buying a self-monitored security system.

Considered that the placement of these cameras is really essential, the criminal activity patterns in locations of interest are normally studied for time periods to identify crime hotspots where cameras might potentially be positioned.
