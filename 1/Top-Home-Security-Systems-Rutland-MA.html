Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests utilizing two different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors located 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to duplicate the issue. Although our screening shouldn't be taken as conclusive, our company believe this issue is not likely to be a real-world problem for SimpliSafe clients who own the existing system.</p>
