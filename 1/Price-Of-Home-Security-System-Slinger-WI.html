<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Also good metal building.

Should be a much better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker.
