<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely regular given that the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when clients recognize that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually far too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
