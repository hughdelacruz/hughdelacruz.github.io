<p>Cross-zoning is a strategy that does not need a new keypad. Utilizing numerous sensing units to monitor activity in one location, software analyses input from all the sources.

A second alarm signal-- gotten in a nearby zone within a brief time-- is the verification the central-station monitor needs to ask for a dispatch instantly.
