<p>The first wireless function to think about is the security system and its elements, and how they all link. In the past, every monitoring element was hard-wired back to a panel box. This implied every windows and door required its own wire and path of holes through your house. Wireless systems use radio frequencies that are only effective up to a specific radius. You will require a system that has a long reception range and can handle a more substantial quantity of information and signals if you have a big home. Keep in mind: A home bigger than 4,500 square feet is generally better off using a wired system.</p>
