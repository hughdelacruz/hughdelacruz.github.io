<p>Unlike many other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event notifications only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is better when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs whenever you stroll by.
