<p>There is a new trend in surveillance video search technology that is quickly altering the security industry, and it is called Deep Knowing". What is Deep Knowing and why is it so important?  For starters, Deep Learning allows someone to discover what they are searching for without having to explore hours of ineffective video footage.  Envision a website that works a lot like a Google search, where you can describe the aspects you are looking for in the tape-recorded video footage.  For example, if we require to see all video from today that has a police car in it, we simply type cops" into the search window and in seconds every key frame of video with a police cruiser appears.  With deep knowing video search, you now have a powerful solution for gathering and capturing wrongdoers proof.</p>
<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) security procedures were later developed to deal with the issues with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be split. Using an enough time random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily chosen words) makes pre-shared crucial WPA virtually uncrackable. The 2nd generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based on the last IEEE 802.11 i amendment to the 802.11 requirement and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance. With all those encryption plans, any client in the network that knows the keys can read all the traffic.</p>
