<p>Establishing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or residential property is the obligation of the whole community. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first question you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The response hinges on a couple of factors: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you mean to keep and for how long you plan to keep documented video footage. The footage is going to eat up storage space rapidly if there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest footage when you reach the system's capability, however if you're not careful, the system may overwrite archived footage that you still need.</p>
