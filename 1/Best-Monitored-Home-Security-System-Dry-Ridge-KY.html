<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, the majority of burglar alarms work the specific same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electrical current.

Which would then set off the burglar alarm if someone were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be moved. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, unlocking permits the electrical current to flow throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will activate.</p>
