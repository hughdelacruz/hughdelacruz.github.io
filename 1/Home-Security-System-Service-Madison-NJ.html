<p>According to a report, homes that don't have a security system are three times more likely to be robbed. With decades of experience setting up and monitoring video and audio security systems for Seattle homes and businesses, we have actually developed great relationships with both local police forces and their customers. Likewise, do not forget that your wireless network security can be sometimes weak, and prone to exploits. It almost does not matter how strong your password is or if your software application depends on date if cybercriminals can simply hijack your Wi-Fi data.

<p>Most of the cameras we tested require an Air Conditioning outlet, so positioning is definitely an aspect. A couple of models utilize batteries, making placement more flexible, however this requires other compromises, which we highlight in the Competitors area. Wi-Fi protection also impacts where you position a camera: If you wish to put a camera in an area that doesn't get a good Wi-Fi signal, consider updating your router or adding an extender or repeater. (For a look at our networking picks, see our guides to The Best Wi-Fi Router (for The Majority Of People)" and The Best Wi-Fi Extender and Signal Booster") It's a good rule of thumb that if your smartphone or laptop gets good Wi-Fi reception in the location you want to install the camera, you likely won't have a problem.</p>
<p>If you reside in a studio apartment and want to keep tabs on things when you're not home, a security camera can finish the job for a lot less money than what you'll pay for a complete security system. Almost all standalone security cameras connect to your home's Wi-Fi so you can see what's going on from your phone or tablet, and most have built-in sensors that detect motion and sound and will send out push and email notifications when those sensors are set off. You can normally modify the camera's motion level of sensitivity to avoid incorrect alarms due to family pet activity or passing automobiles if the camera is near a window, and you can create a schedule that turns the sensors on and off throughout particular hours of the day.</p>
<p>Unlike Nest, TP-Link doesn't make you register for a feature plan to get the most out of the Kasa Camera Outdoor. By just purchasing the camera, you already get things like custom activity zones, and TP-Link is fairly generous with its complimentary cloud storage (2 days' worth of video history). Audio enhances video surveillance to better discover and analyze occurrences in real-time. As an included advantage, an audio option can be quickly integrated into the existing security system.

Search for a camera that supports up-to-date wireless security procedures, such as WPA2, and make sure it secures web transmission of your user name, your password, and the live feeds.
