I Would definitely purchase from cctvsecuritypros once again. I extremely recommend this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand apart-- it's what supplies the video history and smarter alerts, for instance. However, those functions come at a relatively high cost: $5 monthly ($50 per year) for the very first camera for five days of video history, $10 per month ($100 each year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 per month ($300 per year) for one month of video history.  For each additional camera, the membership is marked down to about half of the preliminary fee. By comparison, Arlo charges $3 monthly for person detection with 30 days of cloud storage, and Logitech charges $10 for those bumps and features storage as much as 31 days.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not excellent-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>
