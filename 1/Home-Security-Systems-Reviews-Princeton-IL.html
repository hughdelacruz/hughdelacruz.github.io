The $299 Nest Web cam IQ Indoor camera has a lot of the very same smarts and features as the Nest Hello speaker.

(We believe this is a more valuable feature if you're putting the Circle 2 outside, where automobiles frequently pass.) Although having the membership makes this camera smarter, it's great that it's not essential, as it is with some cameras, including the Nest Cam.</p>
