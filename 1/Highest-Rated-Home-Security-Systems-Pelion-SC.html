Because their design permits for minimum glare, bullet cameras tend to be among the most popular outdoor choices. In terms of detection, it is better to have a camera geared up with infrared detection instead of motion detection. This will offer more accurate and less regular signals because many times the motion detection is set off by motion such as a tree blowing or an animal running by.</p>
