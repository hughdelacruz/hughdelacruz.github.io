<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Likewise nice metal construction.

Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.

DVRs convert the analog video to digital, which assists to extend storage capability, makes it a lot easier to search archived video, and also enables users to stream video over a network for remote watching from several locations. Frequently, the simple existence of security cameras can frighten less-motivated intruders. But keeping them hidden and out of sight can keep them from being tampered with or harmed by the more figured out robbers. They might also be less careful about covering their faces and their tracks if burglars can not see any security cameras.</p>
