<p>Studies show surveillance cameras decrease crime. HD CCTV systems work with conventional analog CCTV cameras. If you purchased cameras before 2010 or if you have coax cable television (look at the cable behind the TELEVISION that goes to the cable box) in your existing security system that means you have traditional analog CCTV security cameras. If you buy HD-CCTV security system, you can upgrade your existing analog CCTV security system without compromising your coax facilities.

<p>Cameras with built in wifi that speak to an existing network needs to be within 300 feet for optimal efficiency.
