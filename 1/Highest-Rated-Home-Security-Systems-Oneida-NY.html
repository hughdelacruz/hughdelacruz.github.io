<p>Studies show surveillance cameras decrease crime. HD CCTV systems work with conventional analog CCTV cameras. If you purchased cameras before 2010 or if you have coax cable television (look at the cable behind the TELEVISION that goes to the cable box) in your existing security system that means you have traditional analog CCTV security cameras. If you buy HD-CCTV security system, you can upgrade your existing analog CCTV security system without compromising your coax facilities. That's just $0.63 a day (or about $19 a month) for the House Iota All-in-One security camera, an additional contact sensor, and a remote key fob.

All of these cameras can be integrated into the total system so the home can be monitored by video from anywhere. To understand how home wireless security systems work, some basic knowledge of alarm is handy.

<p>Cameras with remote-controlled pan, tilt, and zoom functionality are ideal for providing coverage to bigger areas and enable the user to get the best viewing angle possible without physically re-positioning the camera. Low battery or inconsistent source of power. Lots of wireless systems operate on batteries which, if not changed frequently, can activate a false alarm. Frequent power outages or alter in voltage can also trigger false alarms by harming the system and its sensing units.</p>
<p>Cameras with built in wifi that speak to an existing network needs to be within 300 feet for optimal efficiency. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's placement of the camera close to the NVR is absolutely something to be thought about. For instance if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a concern however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on second story wall, this would cause an interruption in the signal. A wireless bridge is an excellent option for long variety situations where poles and trees are not present.</p>

<p>Keypad: A mobile phone app is a must for usage when you're away from home, however you should not have to fumble with your phone when you're coming and going.
