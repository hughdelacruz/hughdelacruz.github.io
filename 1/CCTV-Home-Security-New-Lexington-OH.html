<p>Discover how to develop, construct, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase worker safety and lower crime. The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, but it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has a fantastic daytime image. In our testing, however, we found the motion sensor to be touchy, with horrible night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot. We are confirming with Arlo whether our unit was malfunctioning, and so we may revisit this evaluation.
