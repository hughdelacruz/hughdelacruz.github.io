The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Also good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
