Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first question you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The answer hinges on a number of factors: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video footage you plan to store and the length of time you prepare to keep documented footage. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the video footage is going to consume storage area rapidly.
