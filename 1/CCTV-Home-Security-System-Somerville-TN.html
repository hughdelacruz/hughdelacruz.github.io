Now, the majority of security systems include a great number of elements, such as a base station, security camera, motion, glass, and entry break sensors, a keypad, and key fobs, to name a few elements.

You need to consider a camera with a really broad field of view if you want to view a large area. The ability to mechanically tilt the camera and pan is a great property also.</p>
