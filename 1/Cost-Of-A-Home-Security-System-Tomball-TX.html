<p>An engaging argument in favor of getting the Circle Safe membership is that it includes individual detection, which makes for smarter smartphone signals-- and, in some cases, fewer false notifies. If the camera is pointed towards a high-traffic location, you will not have to stress over it recording or sending an alert each time the canine walks by. (We believe this is a better feature if you're placing the Circle 2 outside, where cars regularly pass.)

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
