<p>This cool clever alarm has a motion detector and siren in one gadget.

We love that it likewise lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For a lot of homes, you'll need several Minuts throughout your home, which can get costly. It's also worth keeping in mind that it has to be installed on the ceiling (it just keeps an eye on for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly.
