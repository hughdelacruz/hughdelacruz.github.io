<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus vandalism, fraud, and theft. Idea: Frequently keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. We need to once again react to the alarm; each reaction is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder offered to reset the alarm is one method of removing costly incorrect alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a particular level, you can make it automatically shut off the heater. You can automatically make the clever lights turn on to scare away prospective burglars if the motion sensors are triggered.</p>
<p>Though the majority of our attention these days is concentrated on the shift to IP video technology, it is very important to note that analog CCTV security cameras can still be highly reliable for many surveillance applications, especially those on a spending plan. With standard CCTV security cameras, the video signal is processed and transferred in analog format for local seeing from one central monitoring location. However that doesn't mean you can't use analog cameras in an IP-based surveillance environment. Using IP video encoders and other equipment such as digital video recorders and hybrid DVRs makes it possible to utilize your existing analog cameras while migrating into the world of digital surveillance.</p>
