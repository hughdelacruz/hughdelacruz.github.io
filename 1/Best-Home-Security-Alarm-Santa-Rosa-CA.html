<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
