<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do these days - you will probably be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the large amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and often over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reliable, however not suitable with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for additional electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may require less wiring in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera independently, typically by means of 110VAC power.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely regular since the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everybody going into the store.
