Try to find a design that uses a high resolution (1080p), a wide angle lens (140 to 180 degrees), a night vision range up to 25 feet, and budget-friendly cloud storage for recorded video. In some cases it's practical to be able to see what took place just before or after a visitor approaches your door. For that, you'll require a doorbell that uses pre-buffering to record the action occurring before motion is detected or the doorbell is pressed.</p>
<p>Alarm monitoring is part of a total home security system.
