<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely regular since the doorway and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as clients recognize that the affordable consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
