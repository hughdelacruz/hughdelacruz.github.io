It likewise succeeds in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 14 days of totally free storage for motion-trigged video clips, individual detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to store footage locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid subscription plans for extra cloud storage.
