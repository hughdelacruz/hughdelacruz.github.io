<p>There are 2 primary kinds of cameras that can be wired into a video surveillance system: web procedure (IP) cameras and the standard analog cameras. IP cameras are the more modern-day version of analog cameras, and while the specific cameras tend to be a bit more costly, they use a number of features that analog cameras do not. Here's a take a look at the differences in between the two types of camera. Today's wireless home security systems are more stable than they utilized to be.
