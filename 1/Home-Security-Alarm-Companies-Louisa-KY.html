Nest's Secure has the very best style of any system I evaluated, consisting of clever things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one system.

Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, however still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
