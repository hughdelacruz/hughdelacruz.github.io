<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
