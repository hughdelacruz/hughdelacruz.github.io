Surveillance cameras are likewise produced in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. There are some difficult repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not always better.</p>
