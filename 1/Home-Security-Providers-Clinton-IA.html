(The remainder of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.) However considering that the majority of retail theft wouldn't journey an alarm anyway (a worker slipping some additional cash while giving a consumer change, for example), we believe it's more vital to have high-quality images so you have the evidence you need.

Functions 1080p HD camera with night vision. Something we actually liked was the customer-friendly policies-- like the lifetime guarantee on products and the rate-lock warranty for life.
