<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Also great metal construction.

Must be a better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker.
