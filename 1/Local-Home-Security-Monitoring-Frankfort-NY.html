<p>Our CCTV surveillance camera systems are relied on by more than 60,000 organisations, universities, and government facilities, and residential customers. After looking into 4 different security systems, we picked SSA. They gave us the best description of their services and used us more for the cash.

SimpliSafe is not excellent at smart home support.
