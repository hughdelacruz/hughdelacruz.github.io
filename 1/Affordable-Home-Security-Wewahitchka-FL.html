We love that the system consists of a wifi security camera and only informs you when motion is developed by something with the very same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no false signals). Nevertheless, you do need to register for the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get alerts on your phone if the sensing units have been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are available that have key fobs and additional sensors, too.</p>
